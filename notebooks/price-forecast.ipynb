    "# Price forecasting with LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook tries to forecast price of NEAR/USDT using the data from data/near_mod.csv. Which is a modified version of the ohlcv data obtained from binance on the 15m timeframe. It adds 3 support and resistance levels to the data and also tracks a midpoint of the candle. The objective  of this code is to use the data to forecast the midpoint of the next candle. The expectation is that, the open price should either be above or below the midpoint of the candle. If we're able to get a 70% accuracy, then we can use this to trade.\n",
